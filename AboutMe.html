        <h1>About Me:</h1><br/>
        <p>My name is Prashanth Reddy. I am from the country which is best known for it's diverse and vibrant culture, India. I have completed my bachelor's degree from AAA Engineering College in the stream of Computer Science and Engineering in the year 2022. During bachelorâ€™s I learnt the front-end language like HTML, and CSS and back-end language like Python, C and C++.Coming to my personal life I am passion for learning new things and I am a balanced person this makes me unique from others. My favorite color is black. It as a favorite shade is said to represent a strong-willed and determined character. It is associated with strength, authority, and power.  Black's color meaning is symbolic of mystery, power, elegance, and sophistication. It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness.The science of statistics focuses on creating and researching strategies for gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting empirical data. Statistics is challenging for me because it is taught out of context. It is really difficult to learn and apply statistics, until analyzing the data. </p>
